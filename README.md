**CROWDFUNDING APP ON THE BLOCKCHAIN**


Techstack NodeJS, React, Hardhat, Javascript vanilla
Smart contract written in Solidity, deployed to Goerli test chain via Thirdweb.

Group assigment at Blockchain dev program at Medieinstitutet, year 1. The course was Agile project management, weaning that while developing this product we also sat through about 100 meetings trying to get the backlog in order, organizing the ceremonies, documenting every word and also ofc sharing our mad/glad/sads =) A challenge! But lots of fun. 

Thank you JS-Mastery on YT for an excellent tutorial, anf classmates Dahir, Sara and Antony for keeping spirits high when goings got tough =)

Heres a sneak peek:
